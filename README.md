**Fb Chat Cmd** is a wrapper to the maintained fork of [fca-unofficial](https://github.com/XaviaTeam/fca-unofficial) by [XaviaTeam](https://github.com/XaviaTeam). This project is derived from [fb-chat-command](https://github.com/jersoncarin/fb-chat-command) as it does not have the latest APIs.

## ‚ú® About the API

This API is the only way to automate chat functionalities on a user account. We do this by emulating the browser. This means doing the exact same GET/POST requests and tricking Facebook into thinking we're accessing the website normally. Because we're doing it this way, this API won't work with an auth token but requires the credentials of a Facebook account.

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
npx jsr add @itsmenewbie03/fb-chat-cmd
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can configure the following by creating a .env file by default they are both set to true.

```bash
LISTEN_EVENT=true
SELF_LISTEN=true
```

## üí° Example Usage

```javascript
import cmd from "@itsmenewbie03/fb-chat-cmd";

const help = async (matches, event, api) => {
  const list = cmd.list();
  let text = "";
  list.forEach((e) => {
    text += `* ${e.description}\n`;
  });
  await api.sendMessage(
    `Commands Available\n${text}`,
    event.threadID,
    event.messageID,
  );
};

cmd.init({ prefix: "/" });
cmd.add(help, {
  // NOTE: command: a regex will be used determine whether this commands gets executed or not
  command: "^\\bhelp\\b",
  name: "help",
  description: "/help: Get list of commands available",
});
```
